Fix (after initial release):
  ☐ Context
    ☐ Find a way to create associations between modules (child + parent). stylus rendering order works differently than SASS
      - This is essential for `describe inside describe`
      - Try to keep with mixins and not with functions
  ☐ Assert
    ☐ Find a way to validate the use of the assert wrapper function, it falls in the same bag of the module inside module thing.
    ☐ Assert `$default` is being added wrong, and only to the first element `if not first test`
  ☐ Messages
    ☐ `module::child-module` not working. Depends on fixing the context first `IF used with child + parent`
